            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; <br> 
                and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>
